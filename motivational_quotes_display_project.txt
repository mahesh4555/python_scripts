configs:
time_interval
image_names_list
image_names_list_length
curent_image_index
folder_modified_time


Starts
If image_names_list is empty, get all filenames and store it in list, store folder modified time
Read first file from list and update current_index, display the image, sleeps,
wakes up, check for folder_modified_time(from folder),
 if changed, get all filenames, check which is not in list and append those images_file_name the in list 
 or get file and check 
Read second image and update current_index, display the image, sleeps,


Code:
a = ['file1.py','file2.py','file3.py','file4.py']  #image_names_list
b = ['file1.py','file3.py','file4.py', 'file5.py']  #Latest_image_names_list

diff = list(set(a) ^ set(b))  #['file5.py', 'file2.py']

Check files in diff, if present in Latest_image_names_list, add it to the image_names_list, 
                     if not found, delete it from image_names_list.


Alternate way:
set A = {10, 20, 30, 40, 80}
set B = {100, 30, 80, 40, 60}


set A - set B = {10, 20}  #delete files from the list
set B - set A = {100, 60}  #add files to the lsit

Explanation: A - B is equal to the elements present in A but not in B
             B - A is equal to the elements present in B but not in A
