sudo mount -o exec /path/to/mount_point


You haven't done anything wrong. The ext4fs file system supports normal Linux ownership and permissions. You just have to change those so you can access it. For example if you want the "pi" user to be the owner you can run sudo chown -R pi /media/pi/msata to change the ownership.


I think you will find that once mounted normally, without the -o option, it will be accessible by pi, because you changed the ownership of it.

Anyway, you can make a soft link to /media/pi/msata, (if that is what it gets mounted as), in your home directory to make it easier to use.

Code: Select all

ln -s /media/pi/msata mydrive

Then you just access it by using mydrive.

Code: Select all

ls mydrive

will then show all the files on /media/pi/msata.

That depends. The owner on the disk is now set to userid 1000, which is the ID of "pi" on Raspbian. If userid 1000 was "fred" on the other computer it would show up as being owned by "fred".

Test cases:

1. change the ownership of external sd card to root user
2. Place the codebase and test the systemd service runs from ext sd card
3. ensure logrotate works 
4. check update feature works. download directly to the sd card
